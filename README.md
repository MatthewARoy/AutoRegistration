Once upon a time, I didn't want to get up at 7am to register for classes. I wrote a program that signs up for classes through ACES automatically. My friends and I have been using it for the last few years, but I decided the time has come to share it with Duke as a whole.

You must have your desired classes selected in the book bag, and validate your schedule beforehand.

I use the java library htmlunit (http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/). It is the exact same as you loading up a webpage on the server side.
